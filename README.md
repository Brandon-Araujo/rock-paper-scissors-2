This is a Rock Paper Scissors Project built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The first stage of this project involved building a framework with html and JavaScript. The game at this stage operates solely within the console.

    -deepened my understanding of how functions can work together 
    -learned about how to loop through an array
    -solidified my understanding of how to generate random numbers

The second stage of the project involved building a UI and integrating it with the original framework.

    -instilled a better grasp of what CSS is capable of, such as transitions and animations
    -better familiarized myself with using flexbox
    -how to re-engineer/adapt code to work with the UI
    -using DOM manipulation

This project was a great experience in learning how these three languages work together. It was particularly interesting seeing how powerful query selectors/DOM manipulation can be.
